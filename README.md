# E-commerce-Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction
This Python program analyzes e-commerce sales data by performing data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning techniques. It provides insights on the relationship between sales and quantity, unit price, country, and offers recommendations to improve sales.

Project Steps:

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
Perform initial data exploration using head(), shape, and dtypes functions
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately
Convert non-numeric values in Quantity and UnitPrice columns to NaN
Drop rows with non-numeric StockCode values
Convert StockCode column to numeric format
Check for and remove any duplicate rows
Drop rows with NaN values
Examine the distribution of numerical and categorical variables
Investigate the relationship between pairs of variables using Seaborn plots
Perform additional feature engineering by creating new variables or transforming existing ones, if necessary
Calculate and plot the correlation between pairs of variables using heatmap
Use machine learning techniques to predict future sales based on historical data, if applicable. We can use linear regression, decision trees, or other models depending on the data and problem statement.
Summarize findings and provide recommendations based on the analysis. We can suggest ways to improve sales, identify areas of improvement, and highlight key factors that influence sales.
Expected Deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook containing Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and sales prediction
Data visualization using Seaborn plots and correlation heatmap
Model selection, training, and evaluation for sales prediction
A report summarizing our findings, recommendations, and insights gained from the analysis.
Tools and Technologies:

Python and Pandas for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning and sales prediction
Jupyter notebook for code development and documentation.
